Running 'npm install' should install required dependecies including Expo. 
Otherwise install Expo globally first.

Running on Mobile:
    install 'expo go' mobile app on a mobile device.
    make sure your mobile device is connected to the same network as your server.
    run server with 'yarn start' or 'npm start'
    once expo server starts, scan the QR code from your mobile device.

Meant to work in tandem with backend server, but for now will just hold dummy-data.
